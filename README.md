# language-zvm-asm package

Atom editor package that adds language syntax highlighting for z/VM assembler language files as well as the PL/X grammar.

> Not every valid syntax is currently supported, but we're always open to net-improvements if you have a talent for regular expressions and the patience to cope with Atom's restrictions.

> The package currently uses [TextMate Grammar](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars) for Syntax Highlighting and plans on shifting to [Tree-Sitter Grammar](http://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) in near future
